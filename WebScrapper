#Webscrapper using BueatifulSoup library for HTMl data scrapping.
#Using my college College website to webscrap the professors data which is available on website.
#For more information go through the BeautifulSoup documentation.

#First step is to import the libraries!

#For Data handling purpose.
import pandas as pd 

#As BeutifulSoup cannot request the HTTPs, we have to use requests library for this purpose.
import requests as re

#For HTML we scrapping we use BeatifulSoup library
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

#We now have to store the link from which we have to web scrap in a variable.
url = 'https://gim.ac.in/areawisefaculty.php'

#Requesting the source code
request = requests.get(url)

#Extract the data through the source code stored in variable request.
soup = BeautifulSoup(request.content, 'html.parser')
#Here html.parser is used. You can also use parsors such as lxml for this purpose.

#We have to extract the links for individual proffessor profile to extract their data.
#P.S. For better understanding of code further go through basic html syntax's.
Links = soup.find_all('div',{'class':'faculty-list-rgt'})

#Creating a loop to extract all the links
Links_All = []

for i in Links:
    link = i.find_all('a')[0]
    link = link.get('href')
    Links_All.append(link)
    
#Visualise the links
