#For Insatllation and documentation follow this link (https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/performing-optical-character-recognition-with-python-and-pytesseract-using-anaconda-4bfe1ee6a75f)

#Install and import the library
import pytesseract as tess

#Giving the location of OCR exe file
tess.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

#Importing PIL library to read image in Python
from PIL import Image

#Giving the location of the image. Multiple images can aslo be used and a loop can be made to run them all at once.
image = Image.open("C:/Users/akn19/Desktop/SOP/SOP2 Images/18.png")

#Storing the scanned data into a variable
pic = tess.image_to_string(image)

Visualizing the data
print(pic)

Thank you!!!
